## Environment Setup

### Create PCC Instance
Services can be created through Apps Manager Marketplace or by executing cf cli commands

###### Display available PCC plans

```
cf marketplace -s p-cloudcache
```

###### Step 1: Validate PCC service instance is pre created in your org/space

```
cf service s1p-workshop-pcc

```

###### Step 2: Create service key for retrieving connection information for GFSH cli

```
cf create-service-key s1p-workshop-pcc devkey
```

###### Step 3: Retrieve url for PCC cli (GFSH) and corresponding credentials

```
cf service-key workshop-pcc devkey
```

###### Step 4: Retrieve Management Dashboard URL (Pulse) of cloud-cache instance from Service key and use the Operator credentials for logging into the Dashboard

```
Add service-key output

```

**Note**: With Spring Boot Data GemFire (SBDG) it is not necessary to create Regions using operator Tool in development mode. We will take advantage of spring annotations in our code to create regions on the server side. 

## Optional

### Setup PCC Cli (GFSH)

Download the Cli from PivNet - https://network.pivotal.io. Version of software Pivotal GemFire 9.8.3


Note: Version of PCC Cli needs to match that of PCC Cluster.

###### Step 1: Login into to PCC cli (GFSH) using connection information from service key

```
connect --use-http=true --url=https://<gfsh-url> --skip-ssl-validation --user=cluster_operator --password=*******
```

Note: If `go-router` is configured only to use https connection. PCC Cli will ask for SSL/TLS information. If using Public certs, we can skip providing keystore and truststore information.

###### Step 2: create PCC regions on cluster

Note: Region name created on PCC server and client should match

```
create region --name=customer --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT
create region --name=pizza_orders --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT
```

###### Step 3: Access pulse using connection information from service key
