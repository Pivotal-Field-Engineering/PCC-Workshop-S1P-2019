## Run the Pizza Store App

### Access REST API endpoints using Swagger

All REST API endpoints are accessible using HTTP GET.  This is not very RESTful, but is convenient
when accessing this app from your Web browser.

Run the command:

```
$ cf apps
```

to acquire your app's APP-URL.
Use the APP-URL with the following endpoints:

- `GET /preheatOven`

    Loads the `Pizza` region with three pre-defined pizzas.
    This REST API endpoint calls `Repository.save()` for each pizza
    and verifies the pizzas with the `Repository.findById(..)` on the
    `Pizza` region to verify that everything was setup properly.
    It creates these pizzas:

    1. tomato sauce and a cheese topping
    2. Alfredo sauce, and chicken and arugula toppings
    3. pesto sauce, and chicken, cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese toppings
 
    Responds with an HTTP message body of "OVEN HEATED!".

    ```
    $ curl -k https://APP-URL/preheatOven
    ```

- `GET /pizzas`

    Lists the current contents of the `Pizza` region, formatted as
    a JSON array containing `Pizza` objects.
    Returns "No Pizzas Found" if the region is empty.

    ```
    $ curl -k https://APP-URL/pizzas
    ```

- `GET /pizzas/{name}`
     
    Returns the pizza with the given name in JSON form.
    Returns "Pizza \[name\] Not Found"
    if no pizza with the given name exists.

    ```
    curl -k https://APP-URL/pizzas/plain
    ```

- `GET /pizzas/order/{name}\[?sauce=<sauce>\[&toppings=\<topping-1>,\<topping-2>,...,\<topping-N>]]`

    Bakes a pizza of the user's specification,
    with an optional `sauce` (defaults to `TOMATO`)
    and optional `toppings` (defaults to `CHEESE`):

    ```
    curl -k https://APP-URL/pizzas/order/myCustomPizza?sauce=MARINARA&toppings=CHEESE,PEPPERONI,MUSHROOM
    ```
